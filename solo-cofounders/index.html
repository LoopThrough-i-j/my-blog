<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>You have an idea, and you want to build something. Question is, should you do it alone, or with co-founders?</p>

<p>This article is broken down into three parts.</p>

<p>First section talks about Benefits and Drawbacks of Co-Founders, second one the same about Solo Founders, and the last is about – Why I chose to be a Solo Founder.</p>

<p>If you’re like most humans, you might like watching a video in 2x better. Here you go:</p>

<h1 id="co-founders">Co Founders</h1>

<p>Look at the biggest companies of today. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb.</p>

<p>All of them have more than founders. Why is that a trend? Because there are many benefits to having more than one founders.</p>

<h2 id="co-founder-benefits">Co-Founder Benefits</h2>

<p>You probably know most of them, but do you know all? Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="1-work-distribution--complementary-skills">1. Work Distribution + Complementary skills</h3>

<p>The most obvious one is complementing each other with different disciplines needed in Startup.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of splits, and any of the following disciplines are a great fit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Engineering</li>
  <li>Marketing</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Sales</li>
  <li>Raising Capital</li>
  <li>Hiring</li>
  <li>Operations</li>
</ol>

<p>in that order of significance (at least according to me).</p>

<h3 id="2-emotional-support">2. Emotional Support</h3>

<center>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/53vLwXKBbmeic/giphy.gif" /><br />
<em>Pulp Fiction had many lessons. Look at how they support each other!</em>
</center>

<p>When you’re down, they might be up.</p>

<p>When they are down, you better be.</p>

<p>In any journey, emotional support is one of the most critical components of success.</p>

<p>Losing motivation to complete something we started is often due to lack of motivation, and having co-founders reduces those possibilities (except of course when everyone is down).</p>

<h3 id="3-brainstorm-ideas">3. Brainstorm ideas</h3>

<p>Not necessarily that your cofounders are smarter than you (although they should be), even talking out loud and being heard can bring some insightful ideas and thinking.</p>

<h3 id="4-focus">4. Focus</h3>

<center>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0K4i4Cm18z1X1t16/giphy.gif" /><br />
<em>Yes, deep down you want this.</em>
</center>

<p>You, your friends, and everyone else has tonnes of ideas.
Digression is easy. It’s the evil. Having co-founders can help everyone stay on course whenever there’s a distraction. Be it an idea, or a fun ploy.</p>

<p>Having more ideas than bandwidth, feature creep, deprioritizing important things are just some of the common digressions. Having a cofounding team helps keeps everyone accountable and focused on one goal.</p>

<h3 id="5-push">5. Push</h3>

<center>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZJFmfvMutiQ0M/giphy.gif" /><br />
<em>Push.</em>
</center>

<p>Cofounders mean commitment. You commited to doing X, where is it? When would Y be done?</p>

<p>When you’re feeling low, unmotivated, this camaraderie can help give you that nudge enough to reach ignition temperature of enthusiasm and excitement.</p>

<h3 id="6-have-fun-on-the-journey">6. Have fun on the journey</h3>

<center>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/CjP6x9rW7LET6dEbJr/giphy.gif" /><br />
<em>Yes, deep down you want this.</em>
</center>

<p>Have you ever gone to an amusement park alone? You’d notice that it’s a lot more fun when you’re with friends. It can, to be honest, suck going there alone. The reason is because something is fun when you get to share it with others who also experienced it.</p>

<p>Building something is not an act, it’s a process; a journey.</p>

<p>When you’re on this journey with people that you have bond with, you’d have more memories, and a lot more fun.</p>

<h2 id="co-founder-drawbacks">Co-Founder Drawbacks</h2>

<p>But it has its cons too! Some of them big enough to make it a really bad experience.</p>

<p>Read through everything before jumping into a work marriage.</p>

<h3 id="a-hunt-is-hard">a. Hunt is Hard</h3>

<p>If you don’t have a co founder, you’d end up finding one, and it’s not easy. You’ll spend lot of energy and time. It’s always best if you met someone in college, or worked with them in a team, and then later on decided to start the company together.</p>

<p>If you don’t have anyone like that, then searching for people can take a lot of time, energy, and frustration.</p>

<h3 id="b-decision-making">b. Decision Making</h3>

<p>Did you ever have a manager who won’t understand what you’re saying, and you have to convince them to do something?</p>

<p>Perhaps you watched a movie where the Protagonist is stuck explaining to their bosses that the world will come to an end if they don’t evacuate now.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, an introvert-ish personality, it can be frustrating, time and energy consuming to convince someone when you need to make a decision.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest drawbacks of having Co Founders. If they are not aligned on the same page, then convincing them can take more time and energy than actually trying something out.</p>

<h3 id="c-too-much-discussion-too-little-action">c. Too Much Discussion. Too Little Action.</h3>

<p>Building a new feature? You could spend entire day, or days, or even weeks just “discussing” it.</p>

<p>Too much documentation, chats, discussions, push backs, all of them can make you really slow, instead of actually making what you intended to in the first place.</p>

<p>In a startup, it’s almost always more fruitful to take action, than to “discuss”.</p>

<p>Lot of things are limited in startups, most important of them: time and energy. You must do everything to conserve these two.</p>

<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies.</h3>

<p>If you go to r/startups, you’d find 1 out of 4 posts is about them wanting out, or their co-founders leaving.</p>

<p>There could any number of reasons, from personal situation, to change in mindset or things just not working out between the co founders / product.</p>

<p>Imagine you worked super hard in setting up the marketing for the product. There’s lot of great content, partnership deals with Creators, and SEO content to go with it. But… the tech co-founder decides to leave the company.</p>

<p>What do you do next? Your startup might not work any more because you don’t have the product and finding a new cofounder can take ages.</p>

<p>Dependency can be dangerous, and if you don’t know anything about some part of the work, it’s possible that if one of the cards is removed, the entire pyramid falls apart.</p>

<p>Ideally you’d like enough exposure that even if one of the co-founders decides to leave, you know how to take things forward, or find the right resources for it.</p>

<h3 id="mismatch">Mismatch</h3>

<p>I keep reading the phrase “Toxic environment” in different posts. If your co-founders have a different mindset in the long term vision, or difficult attitude, all of it can lead to a Toxic environment.</p>

<p>Remember the reason you started a company? It was to define and set the culture, but if you’re stuck with co-founders who don’t match the culture you wanted, what do you do? You can’t fire them.</p>

<p>Do you just leave your incredible idea for the future?</p>

<h2 id="not-a-drawback">“Not a Drawback”</h2>

<p>I listed all the drawbacks, but one thing I want to underline is something that’s not a drawback.</p>

<p><strong>Equity</strong>.</p>

<p>Don’t make your decision of not having co-founders because you might have to split the equity.</p>

<p>Remember, 10% of 10 million » 100% of $0.</p>

<h2 id="solo-founder-benefits">Solo Founder Benefits</h2>

<p>All the drawbacks of co-founders are essentially Solo Founder advantages. I won’t repeat them and only include things not included above.</p>

<h3 id="learn-learn-learn">Learn Learn Learn</h3>

<p>Why are you doing a startup anyways? You could get a job at FAANG or some big company in your field and earn a lot there.</p>

<p>Well, you get to learn a lot.</p>

<p>If you enjoy learning, you’ll love the journey of doing things alone because they will be exponential.</p>

<p>From writing code to</p>

<h2 id="drawbacks-of-being-a-solo-founder">Drawbacks of being a Solo Founder</h2>

<p>And the list is way too-ooo long.</p>

<h3 id="youll-work-a-lot">You’ll work a lot.</h3>

<p>I doubt this one needs any explanation whatsoever.</p>

<h3 id="fail-a-lot-alone">Fail a lot. Alone.</h3>

<p>Failing is part of the journey. But failing alone can suck. When you fail at something together, it’s easier to laugh it off, and push each other to march ahead.</p>

<p>But what when you’re alone? There’s no laugh, only failure, and trust me it can hurt.</p>

<h3 id="no-emotional-support">No emotional support.</h3>

<p>Happiness increases by sharing, and sorrow decreases. But if you have no-one to share with, there’s no emotional support.</p>

<h3 id="doubtful-investors-and-rightly-so">Doubtful Investors, and Rightly So.</h3>

<p>Accelerators, and investors in general recommend having co-founders. This is in part because they understand how hard it is to build and run a startup alone.</p>

<h3 id="master-of-all">Master of ALL</h3>

<em>Yes, deep down you want this.</em>
</center>

<p>As a lone founder, you must known at least part of everything.</p>

<p>Have an idea?
You should know how to design.</p>

<p>Want to build?
You should know how to code.</p>

<p>Go to production?
Well, you should know how to deploy.</p>

<p>Go to market?
You should know how to market.</p>

<p>Create content?
You should know how to make videos, and write blogs.</p>

<p>Get revenue?
You should know how to create funnels and close.</p>

<p>Hire? Taxes? Administration? Raising Capital?
…</p>

<p>My point being, solo founders need to know everything, as everything in the startup process is an important discipline.</p>

<h1 id="why-did-i-chose-to-start-be-a-solo-founder">Why did I chose to start be a solo founder</h1>

<p>Given so many benefits of having co-founders, you must be wondering, why did I choose to go solo?</p>

<h2 id="well-i-didnt-really-have-an-option">Well, I didn’t really have an option</h2>

<p>All the connections I had at this point</p>

<h2 id="personality-trait">Personality Trait</h2>

<p>Just observing my life experiences, I realized, and came to terms with, that I’m really efficient when I work alone.</p>

<p>The best things, and breakthroughs have happened in the moments when I was alone, and with time I accepted and embraced this reality.</p>

<h2 id="love-for-learning">Love for Learning</h2>

<p>I love learning meaningful things, and going through this experience has expanded my horizons beyond what I would have thought.</p>

<p>Today, I know everything necessary from</p>

<p>Am I successful? That depends on definition, but have I learnt a lot? You bet.</p>

<h1 id="which-path-should-you-choose">Which path should you choose?</h1>

<p>Like most great answers, the answer to this question is also: “It Depends”.</p>

<p>In 90% cases I’d suggest that should start a company with a cofounder.</p>

<p>Look at your personality. What do you really value? Why are you starting a company, or building a product?</p>

<p>Do you know someone that could fill the things you have little experience in?</p>

<p>Are you willing to learn everything? You can’t hire someone to do it for you, even if you do, you’d need to know it yourself.</p>

<p>It’s never black and white, but the one thing I recommend is to get started and take some action. It’s the only correct answer. Well, for the most part.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, keep the equity out of the reasoning.</p>
