You can read more about it in the welcome post: Namaste. What I do: In 2019 I quit my full time job to start technology umbrella company Milkie Way, Inc. headquartered in the bay area, CA. After experimenting with over 10 projects, in 2020 December my team launched our first two products Announce and Point Address. I’m excited about them as they have potential to change the world, and are built to scale and rapidly evolve. In 2021 I built YRL - a marketing platform for everyone. In September 2021, I started my journey as a Content Creator on Youtube. Join my journey. Before Milkie Way, I worked at Google. My experience includes roles across Engineering, Product Development, Security all the way to Sales/Operations and Legal. At Google I switched a lot of jobs in different locations that helped me gain decent exposure to varying set of problems and strategies. How I spend my time: An engineer at heart, my interests lie in a lot of fields, most importantly in the field of constant learning.

    "title": "Starting a Company with Co-Founders, or going Solo?",
    "body": "2021/10/08 - https://media. giphy. com/media/fQZX2aoRC1Tqw/giphy. gif IntroductionYou have an idea, and you want to build something. Question is, should you do it alone, or with co-founders? This article is broken down into three parts. First section talks about Benefits and Drawbacks of Co-Founders, second one the same about Solo Founders, and the last is about – Why I chose to be a Solo Founder. If you’re like most humans, you might like watching a video in 2x better. Here you go:   Note: Liking and Subscribing is Free on Youtube Co FoundersLook at the biggest companies of today. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb. All of them have more than founders. Why is that a trend? Because there are many benefits to having more than one founders. Co-Founder Benefits: You probably know most of them, but do you know all? Let’s take a look: 1. Work Distribution + Complementary skills: The most obvious one is complementing each other with different disciplines needed in Startup. There are many kinds of splits, and any of the following disciplines are a great fit:  Engineering Marketing Design Sales Raising Capital Hiring Operationsin that order of significance (at least according to me). 2. Emotional Support: Pulp Fiction had many lessons. Look at how they support each other!When you’re down, they might be up. When they are down, you better be. In any journey, emotional support is one of the most critical components of success. Losing motivation to complete something we started is often due to lack of motivation, and having co-founders reduces those possibilities (except of course when everyone is down). 3. Brainstorm ideas: Not necessarily that your cofounders are smarter than you (although they should be), even talking out loud and being heard can bring some insightful ideas and thinking. 4. Focus: Yes, deep down you want this. You, your friends, and everyone else has tonnes of ideas. Digression is easy. It’s the evil. Having co-founders can help everyone stay on course whenever there’s a distraction. Be it an idea, or a fun ploy. Having more ideas than bandwidth, feature creep, deprioritizing important things are just some of the common digressions. Having a cofounding team helps keeps everyone accountable and focused on one goal. 5. Push: Push. Cofounders mean commitment. You commited to doing X, where is it? When would Y be done? When you’re feeling low, unmotivated, this camaraderie can help give you that nudge enough to reach ignition temperature of enthusiasm and excitement. 6. Have fun on the journey: Yes, deep down you want this. Have you ever gone to an amusement park alone? You’d notice that it’s a lot more fun when you’re with friends. It can, to be honest, suck going there alone. The reason is because something is fun when you get to share it with others who also experienced it. Building something is not an act, it’s a process; a journey. When you’re on this journey with people that you have bond with, you’d have more memories, and a lot more fun. Co-Founder Drawbacks: But it has its cons too! Some of them big enough to make it a really bad experience. Read through everything before jumping into a work marriage. a. Hunt is Hard: If you don’t have a co founder, you’d end up finding one, and it’s not easy. You’ll spend lot of energy and time. It’s always best if you met someone in college, or worked with them in a team, and then later on decided to start the company together. If you don’t have anyone like that, then searching for people can take a lot of time, energy, and frustration. b. Decision Making: Did you ever have a manager who won’t understand what you’re saying, and you have to convince them to do something? Perhaps you watched a movie where the Protagonist is stuck explaining to their bosses that the world will come to an end if they don’t evacuate now. If you’re like me, an introvert-ish personality, it can be frustrating, time and energy consuming to convince someone when you need to make a decision. This is one of the biggest drawbacks of having Co Founders. If they are not aligned on the same page, then convincing them can take more time and energy than actually trying something out. c. Too Much Discussion. Too Little Action. : Building a new feature? You could spend entire day, or days, or even weeks just “discussing” it. Too much documentation, chats, discussions, push backs, all of them can make you really slow, instead of actually making what you intended to in the first place. In a startup, it’s almost always more fruitful to take action, than to “discuss”. Lot of things are limited in startups, most important of them: time and energy. You must do everything to conserve these two. Dependencies. : If you go to r/startups, you’d find 1 out of 4 posts is about them wanting out, or their co-founders leaving. There could any number of reasons, from personal situation, to change in mindset or things just not working out between the co founders / product. Imagine you worked super hard in setting up the marketing for the product. There’s lot of great content, partnership deals with Creators, and SEO content to go with it. But… the tech co-founder decides to leave the company. What do you do next? Your startup might not work any more because you don’t have the product and finding a new cofounder can take ages. Dependency can be dangerous, and if you don’t know anything about some part of the work, it’s possible that if one of the cards is removed, the entire pyramid falls apart. Ideally you’d like enough exposure that even if one of the co-founders decides to leave, you know how to take things forward, or find the right resources for it. Mismatch: I keep reading the phrase “Toxic environment” in different posts. If your co-founders have a different mindset in the long term vision, or difficult attitude, all of it can lead to a Toxic environment. Remember the reason you started a company? It was to define and set the culture, but if you’re stuck with co-founders who don’t match the culture you wanted, what do you do? You can’t fire them. Do you just leave your incredible idea for the future? “Not a Drawback”: I listed all the drawbacks, but one thing I want to underline is something that’s not a drawback. Equity. Don’t make your decision of not having co-founders because you might have to split the equity. Remember, 10% of 10 million » 100% of $0. Solo Founder Benefits: All the drawbacks of co-founders are essentially Solo Founder advantages. I won’t repeat them and only include things not included above. Learn Learn Learn: Why are you doing a startup anyways? You could get a job at FAANG or some big company in your field and earn a lot there. Well, you get to learn a lot. If you enjoy learning, you’ll love the journey of doing things alone because they will be exponential. From writing code to Drawbacks of being a Solo Founder: And the list is way too-ooo long. You’ll work a lot. : I doubt this one needs any explanation whatsoever. Fail a lot. Alone. : Failing is part of the journey. But failing alone can suck. When you fail at something together, it’s easier to laugh it off, and push each other to march ahead. But what when you’re alone? There’s no laugh, only failure, and trust me it can hurt. No emotional support. : Happiness increases by sharing, and sorrow decreases. But if you have no-one to share with, there’s no emotional support. Doubtful Investors, and Rightly So. : Accelerators, and investors in general recommend having co-founders. This is in part because they understand how hard it is to build and run a startup alone. Master of ALL: Yes, deep down you want this. As a lone founder, you must known at least part of everything. Have an idea?You should know how to design. Want to build?You should know how to code. Go to production?Well, you should know how to deploy. Go to market?You should know how to market. Create content?You should know how to make videos, and write blogs. Get revenue?You should know how to create funnels and close. Hire? Taxes? Administration? Raising Capital?… My point being, solo founders need to know everything, as everything in the startup process is an important discipline. Why did I chose to start be a solo founderGiven so many benefits of having co-founders, you must be wondering, why did I choose to go solo? Well, I didn’t really have an option: All the connections I had at this point Personality Trait: Just observing my life experiences, I realized, and came to terms with, that I’m really efficient when I work alone. The best things, and breakthroughs have happened in the moments when I was alone, and with time I accepted and embraced this reality. Love for Learning: I love learning meaningful things, and going through this experience has expanded my horizons beyond what I would have thought. Today, I know everything necessary from Am I successful? That depends on definition, but have I learnt a lot? You bet. Which path should you choose?Like most great answers, the answer to this question is also: “It Depends”. In 90% cases I’d suggest that should start a company with a cofounder. Look at your personality. What do you really value? Why are you starting a company, or building a product? Do you know someone that could fill the things you have little experience in? Are you willing to learn everything? You can’t hire someone to do it for you, even if you do, you’d need to know it yourself. It’s never black and white, but the one thing I recommend is to get started and take some action. It’s the only correct answer. Well, for the most part. Whatever you do, keep the equity out of the reasoning. Curious about what I am building?I’m building YRL - a marketing platform that makes it super easy for Businesses and Creators to partner on the basis of Cost per Click / Conversion.

    "title": "Product Lessons from $1 Lint Remover",
    "body": "2021/01/22 - What is a great product user experience? This article shares the product lessons hidden in mighty Lint removers. My black jeans looks ugly: A few days ago during a call with my friend, I was asked a simple question: how to remove white particles (lint) from brand new black jeans? My friend who I was on call with, had recently bought a black pair of jeans. Right after leaving home he realized that it was full of lint which made this brand new pair look like an old used jeans. This problem is quite simple if you know the solution, but if you don’t know how to solve it, I promise that it’s one of the hardest challenges humans have faced in the field of personal image and self confidence. If Seinfeld was Indian, there would be a show on Lint: Growing up in India, I witnessed lint as a big problem. It’s just that neither I, nor anyone I knew had a solution to it. Lint always appeared on woolen coats during winter seasons and affected everyone without a bias. I was exposed to brushing the coats, the only known solution, which seldom made a difference. Year after year, people would buy expensive coats for winter, and soon they’d be destroyed by varying kinds of lint. On special events, helpless and without a choice, people would wear their fancy linted coats that looked old and worn out. I wonder if this was one of the reasons why my mother never let me buy black clothes (this and the summer heat). Years ago when I first moved to the US, my another Indian friend had proudly introduced me to the lint remover. He got it from Dollar Tree, and the joy on his face sharing this discovery with me was the same as if he had won a lottery. He (and now I) had discovered the solution to a decade old problem that affected our self confidence; perhaps still does to a billion+ people. Aha! It’s magic!: (Back to present. ) During the ongoing call with my friend, I shared my profound wisdom and exposed him to the mighty lint remover. After 20 minutes I got a call back from him. “It’s magic!” he exclaimed. I vicariously relived the joy in that moment. Aha!We next discussed what a great user experience is, and how I should focus on creating products that bring out a similar Aha moment in users. What’s a great product?: A great product isn’t necessarily the one that uses ground breaking technology. It’s the one that solves a real world problem for users – very simply. It doesn’t matter how many users use it, for each one of them the experience by itself should bring joy, relief, and a feeling of eureka. Mightly Lint RemoverA lint remover -  solves a real world problem that affects most people who wear clothes takes few seconds to understand and few steps to use can be used anywhere, and is independent of any other technology immediately solves the problem, with impact highly visible to the user is cheap, uses simple technology that is easy to produce and scaleUsing Youtube, Search, or Video Chat applications may not feel like eureka! to us anymore, but try to imagine what emotions they bring to someone who has never used these products before, better yet, never imagined their existence. It’s a feeling of joy and wonder that has the sound “Aha!”. Of course these are high tech products, but they are nowhere close to discovering uranium, or successful genetic cloning. Note: I talk about Lint removers as a generic product, not a product from X company which is sturdy and fits in travel bag. In this sense Lint Removers can be considered as an invention. Most startups creating new unconventional products fall in a similar category. My projects fail the Lint Remover’s baseline: After the discussion with my friend, I started to think: why has he never called me up after testing my early stage projects? Why am I not building things that bring out the same emotions in him as does a $1 lint remover? For a moment I felt dejected. In a few minutes I had the answer. If Lint remover was such a great product, why did it take my friend so long to discover it? My friend had this eureka moment, not because Lint remover is a great product. He had this moment because he found it when he had a pressing problem problem at hand, affecting him personally. If I shared the same product with my friend when he was wearing blue jeans, I doubt he would have had the same experience. In other words, creating a great incredible product isn’t sufficient. The lint remover doesn’t become mighty lint remover until it reaches people who are experiencing the problem it solves. Creation isn't enoughDistribution, availability, and introduction at the time of need are, if not more, as important to the product as the invention itself. Could this be the reason why my friend hasn’t called me to share the Aha! moment he had while testing my projects? The job of a creator doesn’t end at creating the product that’s cheap, simple, scalable, does the job well etc. The job of a creator ends when the user in need discovers, uses the product to solve a problem and says ‘Aha! It’s magic. ’ "

    "title": "Wow, how cool I did that then!",
    "body": "2021/01/14 - In the last few weeks, the power of long term thinking has been consistently on my mind. This post is dedicated to long term thinking / actions, and an attempt to answer the age old interview question: “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?”. Interviews and Goosebumps: Over the course of time, I have given a lot of interviews for different positions. Every single time, no matter how many interviews I have given or aced until that point, I still get goosebumps. One age old question: “Where do you see yourself in X years” keeps coming up either in interviews or during preparation. The purpose of this question is to know the aspirations of the candidate and see how the given position will fit in their grand vision of their life. I have always hated this question. Hate is a very strong emotional word, and I’m aware of this. There are few reasons why I am so passionately against this question: Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in 5 years? (honest responses in my head)  Should I say what I really think, or should I say what you want to hear? I would like to live like James Bond, travel the world, drive fancy cars and look cool. Just kidding (I’m not).  Do you have nothing else left to ask but this old question? I want to run my own company. Oh wait, how is this job going to help me get there? 5 years… isn’t that too long to start my own thing? I should do it sooner. Why am I here again? Oh I need a job to pay my bills.  There are too many things I want to do. Which one should I say? I’m still figuring life out.  If my ambitions are bigger than yours, how do I know your ego won’t reject me? I want to make XYZ amount of money, life standard, position. But that’s an outcome, which isn’t necessarily in my hands pay off the loans. Take care of my parents. Travel a lot! Will I be judged now? How is this answer going to increase my odds of selection? To be honest, this is a very personal question. You’re asking me my dreams. They are close to me, and heavily protected. I’m afraid I can’t answer this as I barely know you. How about, where I see myself in next 6 months?I have been asked this question a few times. The time that I remember well, my response was a well rounded diplomatic one. Something on the lines of becoming capable and deserving of doing something big. I got that job. Clock of the Long Now: Few years ago, I read in news that Jeff Bezos is spending millions of dollars to make a clock devoted to long term thinking. I really liked the concept and idea of this. It’s an expensive clock, but it carries an important message. It’s also one of the very few monuments that our generation is building that could potentially stand out in future. 10,000 hour clock prototypeIn most of his interviews, Jeff Bezos talks about power of long term thinking. Not only him, but most leaders keep iterating the same phrase over and over again. Sundar Pichai in his investor calls often repeats: “we are investing heavily in long term bets”. While I’ve always really liked and believed in the concept of long term thinking, as years are passing by, my understanding of this concept is growing deeper. Mostly because now I have some personal decisions I took in the past that have visible impact on my life now. Some of which I say “Wow, I did this then”, and also those that make me say: “I wish I had done this then”. The feelings of joy and regret on past actions get more intense with every passing year. Jeff Bezos must feel this even more intensely; so much that he decided to spend time and energy into devoting a heavily engineered clock into it. Long term thinking is real. You’re not alone feeling this way Mr. Bezos. How about a more meaningful question Interviewer?: Where I see myself in X years has lot of caveats and real world variables involved. I can’t really say something that I haven’t decided or am unaware of its existence. I also can’t say something that isn’t completely in my hands. As an intelligent being applying for this job, I definitely shouldn’t say any of this as I might come across undecisive, and as honest + meaningful this comment may look in this post, it won’t get me the job which requires “proactive, decisive self starters”. What I want to do in X years has much to do with those X years, as they have the power to shape my aspirations. But what if we asked a slightly different question?  What are the X things that you’re doing today, that you will see results of in 5 years? Well, there are many! I am  working out every other day, so I’ll be stronger, healthier and more attractive.  giving this interview, and hopefully I’ll have a more secure immediate future. If not I’ll apply to other places and depending on what I learn my career would take shape.  learning xyz instrument so I should be able to play at least few songs :) writing a list of all the places I want to see in the world. Just applied for my passport… let’s see how far I get.  listening to pod cast on habits, and becoming better version of me. I’ll have a greater personality in 5 years.  reading a lot about investing and becoming rich.  improving my communication skills.  writing on medium, reddit and twitter / creating youtube videos, perhaps I’ll have a side income in 5 yearsMost humans are not static states, but more like dynamic stages of evolution. We simply aren’t; we are becoming. There’s value in asking what we are becoming, not what our present self thinks what we want to be.  We simply aren’t; we are becoming. That’s awesome but how in the world is this question going to help me review the candidature? Well, for one you’re asking a more meaningful question, so you can expect a more meaningful and honest response. There are few things you can get out of this question:  Learning more about the candidate, how they spend their time and what’s important to them.  Actions today show what I’m really interested in. If someone wants to be social media marketer, but hasn’t even tried uploading a video on Youtube, or on any other social media platform, it’s highly unlikely they will lead that path.  Leadership inherits long term vision. If I’m spending time doing something consistently, I must be internally motivated to do it. Motivation to do something for long term can only be due to a larger goal, a vision. This is an important leadership trait.  Determine passion: it doesn’t matter if it’s collecting old song records, or listening to audiobooks everyday. This question indirectly shows what the person is passionate about, or if they are even passionate about something at all. Depending on the profile, the question can be tuned, but it definitely opens up the conversation into a more meaningful, less defensive and more productive time spend. Mango Seed Whistles: I grew in northern India and as a child, I used to look forward to mangoes every summer. When I was little, my mom showed me how to make whistles with Mango seedlings. If you’re curious what Mango seed whistles look like, I found this video on Youtube for you: Part of creating this whistle requires that the Mango seed to be sowed into the soil for a day or two, while waiting for it to germinate. As I used to eat lots of mangoes, I would put all of them in soil in our little backyard. This one time, I forgot to take one of the seeds out of the soil and it started growing into a plant. My parents didn’t remove the plant, and it kept growing bigger. As I grew up, so did the mango tree. By the time I was a teenager, the tree started giving mangoes. The mangoes were smaller than market bought mangoes probably because we never fed the tree anything except what the soil already had, yet they were delicious. There’s another concept called grafting, which I would learn about later, but I digress. Mango tree from internetThe mango tree I grew as a little boy unbeknownstly was an investment. What could happen if I plant trees knowingly, constantly and consistently? What seeds am I sowing today that I can reap in 1, 2, 5, 20 and 50 years from now? As time is progressing, I keep wondering about these questions and scratching my head thinking what I should be investing in now. The future would be amazing if I look back and only have to say: “Wow, how cool I did that then”. "

Introduction: This site will host my experiences, learnings and thoughts to the potential reader(s). Honestly, I never really thought of writing content on my own site. Instead I always believed that it makes more sense to write for the products I am/was building. Earlier this month I wrote a blog post on our company blog: “We burnt $72K and almost went bankrupt” which sort of went viral. There were definitely more than 72K views on the blog post, and it was translated to more than few languages on popular sites across the world. I published the blog on our company blog because it was connected to our company’s journey. It was after publishing the blog post that I realized that there’s so much I could share, most of which won’t be a good fit for the company blog but definitely acceptable on my own, which brings us to this blog blog. sudcha. com. Topics and Periodicity: This blog isn’t for a particular niche, because honestly I’m all over the place. I intend to cover topics from business, engineering, technology and random rants. Writing isn’t my first priority, and for this reason, many of my posts may be sporadic, and about past events. Everything is an expression: I believe that everything in the universe is an expression. In fact, the universe itself is an expression of itself. For us humans who have relatively more choice and freedom than other species, everything we do is to express ourselves. Everything is an expression. From how we drive, dress, write, create and share, everything is an expression of our existence. This blog is a channel for my expressions based on my learnings and experiences. I hope the posts here provide some value to the world who has given me so much. Future Posts?: If you’d like to get updates, you can subscribe with your email address at the end of this page. Alternately, you can also connect with me and I’ll post everytime there’s a new blog. Love and Hate: There’s no comment section on the blog yet, but depending on how popular (or unpopular) it gets, I might consider adding it. Regardless of how good or bad the content is, there shouldn’t be room for hate. If you don’t like the content, you can simply click here. If you like it, share it, add references to it, and keep reading on :) "
