        <title>&apos;The Unconventional Founder&apos; Youtube Channel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After overcoming a deeply rooted resistance, I finally started a Youtube channel. This post explains why it was so difficult, and what understanding convinced me to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we learn better with visuals than reading, so here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;yt-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UPbJG26Y9iE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;Namastey! Like and Subscribe :)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still prefer to read? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hesitation&quot;&gt;The Hesitation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been deeply inspired by great tech founders from Larry Page, to Elon Musk. From Steve Jobs to Jeff Bezos. All of them have built incredible products and companies, though none of them have been active content creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everytime you see a video of them on Youtube, 99% of the times it would be that of an interview in a conference. The rest 1% is when they are introducing / launching a product to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the founders of Youtube all the way to founders of Alphabet / Google, none of them have actively created content themselves (except of course, the first video on Youtube).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few simple reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating Content takes time, which tech founders could be spending in building products, teams and scaling their services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology startup founders usually have a different type of personality than those of content creators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In tech sector, even today, writing is a much more preferred medium, and a more powerful way of conveying messages to the world, with Audio only podcasts as probably the closest cousin. No wonder Elon Musk sticks to Twitter, and so do 99.9% of other people in tech industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech founders and engineers prefer to be private in general. You‚Äôd never really know where these founders are, or how they are spending their time. It‚Äôs probably because they understand technology and its drawbacks way more than most people can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs better to be wealthy and anonymous than to be rich and famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always identified myself to be one of those founders that remain private, away from public eye. Spending time hacking problems that impacted everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the last few months, something changed. As if a button flipped, and all of a sudden I wanted to be a content creator. A Youtuber as it aligns the most with my personality, and very committed to creating videos about anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-switch-flip&quot;&gt;The Switch Flip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn‚Äôt one single moment, but a lots of them that one after the other just kept blowing up my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-share-mistakes-and-learnings&quot;&gt;1. Share Mistakes and Learnings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a technology startup founder, if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve been doing consistently is making mistakes, and learning from them. When you undergo an experience like that, there‚Äôs an internal voice that wants to share those learnings with someone who may find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs more stylish and pep thing to be a startup founder today than it has ever been. There‚Äôs an exponential increase in the number of startups worldwide, and I believe we are still at the beginning of this global explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single year to come, there will be more entrepreneurs than there have ever been in the past, which means if I share my learnings, the potential audience that might benefit from those learnings will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-give-back&quot;&gt;2. Give Back&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you and everyone else today, most of what I‚Äôve learned is from others online. Be it through Blogs or Youtube videos, then why shouldn‚Äôt I give something in return as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-not-enough-practical-channels&quot;&gt;3. Not enough Practical Channels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of channels on youtube that teach how to write code. There are also lot of channels which talk about startup ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù. But I still feel the gap between the two categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs still not enough video content that takes someones from coming up with an idea, all the way through executing it IRL. There‚Äôs a lot of content that does this well but it‚Äôs spread sparsely through blogs, and reddit posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm hopeful that I can help in reducing this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-yrl--get-yrl-go-viral&quot;&gt;4. YRL : Get Yrl, Go Viral!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a product called YRL (&lt;a href=&quot;getyrl.com&quot;&gt;getyrl.com&lt;/a&gt;), where Businesses and Creators can partner with Cost per Click and Cost per Conversion campaigns. It‚Äôs blazing fast, simple and easy to use. I‚Äôd call it Robinhood of digital and affiliate marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;customized-button&quot; onclick=&quot; window.open(&apos;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgumVa37_24jNvYizs7kUiw&apos;,&apos;_blank&apos;)&quot;&gt;
Checkout YRL ‚Üí
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the product as a Business because marketing a product is really hard today thanks to the ocean of content online. But the story was still incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YRL is not just for Businesses, its more for Creators. If I want to make YRL successful, being a Business is not enough. I should be a content creator myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-pushing-comfort-zone&quot;&gt;5. Pushing Comfort Zone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recording, Editing, Publishing, and Promoting content in its entirety is a different ball game than anything related to writing code, thinking of architecture. or building a product. Coding skills don‚Äôt help at all to be honest (trust me I tried making videos using Python!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning each of these bits is a new challenge for me, and a big way to grow personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-its-unconventional&quot;&gt;6. It‚Äôs Unconventional&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are channels for almost every type of content, it‚Äôs still pretty new for founders of tech startups to post content online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because historically, the personality type of tech founders has been very different from that of content creators (Youtubers for example). There are probably a handful of tech founders who are actively creating videos online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds unconventional, and thus my calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-new-territory&quot;&gt;7. New Territory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Youtube videos is a new territory for me and it comes with its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From learning how to record, edit and create engaging content, to how to get more views, likes and subscribers, there are more things to learn in Content Creation than I could have ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-passive-income-source&quot;&gt;8. Passive Income Source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the stock investments, I don‚Äôt really have any passive income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm hopeful that at some point creating content would bring in some passive income to support my entrepreneurial journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-run-marketing-experiments&quot;&gt;9. Run Marketing Experiments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I could run not one, two but thousand different marketing experiments? As a founder it sounds incredibly exciting. This is true for social media and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to run so many experiments, feels like a super power to me, and I‚Äôm really excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-ability-to-convey-ideas&quot;&gt;10. Ability to Convey Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above reasons are valid and good reasons, but the biggest reason why I want to solve is because I want to learn how to convey ideas that stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It the most important part of any successful startup, probably the only one, and if I can master it, I can make not one but many, many successful products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-journey-begins&quot;&gt;The Journey Begins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I go, the next phase of my journey -&amp;gt; making popular videos online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven‚Äôt already, don‚Äôt miss your chance at 10 years of good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Product Lessons from $1 Lint Remover</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a great product user experience? This article shares the product lessons hidden in mighty Lint removers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-black-jeans-looks-ugly&quot;&gt;My black jeans looks ugly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago during a call with my friend, I was asked a simple question: &lt;em&gt;how to remove white particles (lint) from brand new black jeans?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend who I was on call with, had recently bought a black pair of jeans. Right after leaving home he realized that it was full of lint which made this brand new pair look like an old used jeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is quite simple if you know the solution, but if you don‚Äôt know how to solve it, I promise that it‚Äôs one of the hardest challenges humans have faced in the field of personal image and self confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-seinfeld-was-indian-there-would-be-a-show-on-lint&quot;&gt;If Seinfeld was Indian, there would be a show on Lint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in India, I witnessed lint as a big problem. It‚Äôs just that neither I, nor anyone I knew had a solution to it. Lint always appeared on woolen coats during winter seasons and affected everyone without a bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was exposed to brushing the coats, the only known solution, which seldom made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year after year, people would buy expensive coats for winter, and soon they‚Äôd be destroyed by varying kinds of &lt;em&gt;lint&lt;/em&gt;. On special events, helpless and without a choice, people would wear their fancy &lt;em&gt;linted&lt;/em&gt; coats that looked old and worn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this was one of the reasons why my mother never let me buy black clothes (this and the summer heat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago when I first moved to the US, my another Indian friend had proudly introduced me to &lt;strong&gt;the lint remover&lt;/strong&gt;. He got it from Dollar Tree, and the joy on his face sharing this discovery with me was the same as if he had won a lottery. He (and now I) had discovered the solution to a decade old problem that affected our self confidence; perhaps still does to a billion+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aha-its-magic&quot;&gt;Aha! It‚Äôs magic!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Back to present.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the ongoing call with my friend, I shared my profound wisdom and exposed him to the mighty lint remover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes I got a call back from him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs magic!‚Äù he exclaimed. I vicariously relived the joy in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great-ux/wow.gif&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Aha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We next discussed what a great user experience is, and how I should focus on creating products that bring out a similar Aha moment in users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-a-great-product&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs a great product?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great product isn‚Äôt necessarily the one that uses ground breaking technology. It‚Äôs the one that solves a real world problem for users ‚Äì very simply. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many users use it, for each one of them the experience by itself should bring joy, relief, and a feeling of eureka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great-ux/roller.jpg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mightly Lint Remover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lint remover -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;solves a real world problem that affects most people who wear clothes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;takes few seconds to understand and few steps to use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can be used anywhere, and is independent of any other technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;immediately solves the problem, with impact highly visible to the user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is cheap, uses simple technology that is easy to produce and scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Youtube, Search, or Video Chat applications may not feel like &lt;em&gt;eureka!&lt;/em&gt; to us anymore, but try to imagine what emotions they bring to someone who has never used these products before, better yet, never imagined their existence. It‚Äôs a feeling of joy and wonder that has the sound &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúAha!‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course these are high tech products, but they are nowhere close to discovering uranium, or successful genetic cloning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I talk about Lint removers as a generic product, not a product from X company which is sturdy and fits in travel bag. In this sense Lint Removers can be considered as an invention. Most startups creating new unconventional products fall in a similar category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-projects-fail-the-lint-removers-baseline&quot;&gt;My projects fail the Lint Remover‚Äôs baseline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the discussion with my friend, I started to think: why has he never called me up after testing my early stage projects? Why am I not building things that bring out the same emotions in him as does a $1 lint remover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment I felt dejected. In a few minutes I had the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Lint remover was such a great product, why did it take my friend so long to discover it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend had this eureka moment, not because Lint remover is a great product. He had this moment because he found it when he had a &lt;em&gt;pressing problem problem at hand&lt;/em&gt;, affecting him personally. If I shared the same product with my friend when he was wearing blue jeans, I doubt he would have had the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, creating a great incredible product isn‚Äôt sufficient. The lint remover doesn‚Äôt become &lt;em&gt;mighty&lt;/em&gt; lint remover until it reaches people who are experiencing the problem it solves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great-ux/design.jpg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Creation isn&apos;t enough&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribution, availability, and introduction &lt;strong&gt;at the time of need&lt;/strong&gt; are, if not more, as important to the product as the invention itself. Could this be the reason why my friend hasn‚Äôt called me to share the Aha! moment he had while testing my projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of a creator doesn‚Äôt end at creating the product that‚Äôs cheap, simple, scalable, does the job well etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of a creator ends when the user in need &lt;em&gt;discovers&lt;/em&gt;, uses the product to solve a problem and says &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòAha! It‚Äôs magic.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namaste</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to sudcha.com! This is the first post of the blog and I‚Äôd like to share how this site came into existence, and what purpose it serves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site will host my experiences, learnings and thoughts to the potential reader(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I never really thought of writing content on my own site. Instead I always believed that it makes more sense to write for the products I am/was building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I wrote a blog post on our company blog: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-1/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe burnt $72K and almost went bankrupt‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; went viral. There were definitely more than 72K views on the blog post, and it was translated to more than few languages on popular sites across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I published the blog on our company blog because it was connected to our company‚Äôs journey. It was after publishing the blog post that I realized that there‚Äôs so much I could share, most of which won‚Äôt be a good fit for the company blog but definitely acceptable on my own, which brings us to this blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sudcha.com&quot;&gt;blog.sudcha.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics-and-periodicity&quot;&gt;Topics and Periodicity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog isn‚Äôt for a particular niche, because honestly I‚Äôm all over the place. I intend to cover topics from business, engineering, technology and random rants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing isn‚Äôt my first priority, and for this reason, many of my posts may be sporadic, and about past events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;everything-is-an-expression&quot;&gt;Everything is an expression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that everything in the universe is an expression. In fact, the universe itself is an expression of itself. For us humans who have relatively more choice and freedom than other species, everything we do is to express ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://loopthrough-i-j.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/general/expression.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Everything is an expression.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From how we drive, dress, write, create and share, everything is an expression of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is a channel for my expressions based on my learnings and experiences. I hope the posts here provide some value to the world who has given me so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-posts&quot;&gt;Future Posts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôd like to get updates, you can subscribe with your email address at the end of this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://loopthrough-i-j.github.io/my-blog/contact&quot;&gt;connect with me&lt;/a&gt; and I‚Äôll post everytime there‚Äôs a new blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;love-and-hate&quot;&gt;Love and Hate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no comment section on the blog yet, but depending on how popular (or unpopular) it gets, I might consider adding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how good or bad the content is, there shouldn‚Äôt be room for hate. If you don‚Äôt like the content, you can simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cute+kitten&quot;&gt;click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like it, &lt;strong&gt;share it&lt;/strong&gt;, add references to it, and keep reading on :)&lt;/p&gt;
